# Express API

`npm run dev`

## Goals

[ ] set up a basic local server (I guess I should build a client at some point...)
[ ] get 1 basic CRUD setup for a general resource (including some database peristance)
[ ] get user authorization in place
[ ] get a smooth deployment process
[ ] make the API the best it can be (I'm reading 'The design of web apis' & watching a traversy class & reading 'express in action')
[ ] get more info about security (I'm reading 'The design of web apis' & 'secure by design');
[ ] add a few related resources
[ ] maybe get some 'roles' for users?
[ ] investigate a way to have a node app that is simultaniousyly an API without too much repitition
[ ] consider the latest cloud CMS options (prismic etc.)
[ ] whatever other things come up...
